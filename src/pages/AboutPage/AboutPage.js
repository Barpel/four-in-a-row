                Hi, I'm Bar Peled and I'm a fan of Board Games!<br />
                My professional time is normally spent developing advanced Full Stack progressive web applications.<br />
                I specialize developing in HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular and jQuery.<br />
                I also develop using Node.JS, MongoDB, Firebase, MySQL and GraphQL.<br />
                My free time, on the other hand, is usually spent on the dance floor, practicing my Salsa steps.<br />
                Happy to connect!
